# Business Challenge: Cohort Analysis for Ironhack Payments

## Introduction

IronHack Payments, a forward-thinking financial services company, has been offering innovative cash advance solutions since its inception in 2020. With a commitment to providing money advancements for free and transparent pricing, IronHack Payments has garnered a substantial user base. As part of their continuous effort to enhance their services and understand user behavior, IronHack Payments has commissioned a cohort analysis project.

## Project Overview

In this project, you will conduct a comprehensive cohort analysis based on data provided by IronHack Payments. The main objective is to analyze user cohorts defined by the month of creation of their first cash advance. You will track the monthly evolution of key metrics for these cohorts, enabling IronHack Payments to gain valuable insights into user behavior and the performance of their financial services.


### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Before diving into cohort analysis, conduct an exploratory data analysis to gain a comprehensive understanding of the dataset. Explore key statistics, distributions, and visualizations to identify patterns and outliers. EDA will help you make informed decisions on data preprocessing and analysis strategies.


### Deliverables

1. **Python Code with EDA:** Provide well-documented Python code that conducts the cohort analysis, including data loading, preprocessing, cohort creation, metric calculation, and visualization.
2. **Data analysis dashboard** Dashboard that will allow monthly review of key metrics.
3. **Short Presentation:** Create a concise presentation (maximum of 4 slides) summarizing your findings from the cohort analysis and key insights gained from EDA and data quality analysis. This presentation should be suitable for sharing with the IronHack Payments team.
